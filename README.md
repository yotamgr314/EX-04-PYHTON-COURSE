##  Analysis Steps
1. **Correlation Heatmap**:
   - Visualized correlations between all features and identified `ram` as strongly correlated with `price`.

2. **Scatter Plots**:
   - Plotted relationships between `ram`, `px_width`, `px_height`, and `price`.

3. **Feature Processing**:
   - Added ordinal and nominal features to enhance the dataset.

4. **Price Transformation Analysis**:
   - Identified a linear transformation for `price_2` based on `ram`.
